                                        <p>
                                            All you need to do is enter the name of the
                                            player whose stats you’d like to view. Once you’ve done that, the website
                                            will pull up detailed information about the player's progress, skills, and
                                            more. The interface is designed to be clean and easy to navigate, so you can
                                            focus on what matters: tracking your achievements and planning your next
                                            in-game goals.

                                        <h3>Welcome, and Thank You for Visiting!</h3>
                                        <p>
                                            First of all, I want to sincerely thank you for taking the time to visit and
                                            explore this project. Your interest means a lot, and I hope you find the
                                            site useful and enjoyable.

                                            This project was born out of my frustration with the current state of the
                                            RuneMetrics website. While RuneMetrics provides some useful data, I felt it
                                            lacked the user-friendliness and depth of information that many players,
                                            including myself, were looking for. I wanted more detailed insights into
                                            player stats, better navigation, and quality-of-life features that could
                                            make tracking progress more intuitive and enjoyable. So, instead of waiting
                                            for improvements, I decided to take matters into my own hands and build
                                            something that I—and hopefully the community—could truly benefit from.
                                        </p>

                                            This project isn’t just for me—it’s for the entire RuneScape community. I’d
                                            love to hear your feedback, suggestions, and ideas on how we can make this
                                            even better. Together, we can build a resource that makes tracking stats and
                                            progress as exciting as the game itself.
